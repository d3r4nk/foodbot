Process the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well.
Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, agave nectar, and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms.
Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres.
Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :)
If you choose to, gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles, unsweetened coconut flakes, and extra cocoa powder.

665170,White Chocolate Cherry Hand Pies,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/665170-556x370.jpg,45,"Prepare the pie crust first. In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible.
Add oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour.
While the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
When the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles.
Place half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one.
I added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies.
Wet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure.
Use the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.
Bake for 20 minutes.

Add honey and salt; mix to dissolve. Add basil leaves, stir and allow them to wilt in the mixture; remove saucepan from heat.  Pour mixture into a blender and emulsify until completely creamy and no chunks of basil are visible (if this is not possible in your blender you can strain out the basil pieces with a fine wire strainer/colander if you would like or you can leave the basil pieces in the mixture).  Allow mixture to cool 20 minutes; this allows the flavors to infuse.  Pour mixture in a large container and refrigerate a few hours until cool.
If using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly (the one I used sits on the counter. You just plug it in, turn it on chill mode, allow the built-in bowl to get cool, then pour in the ice cream mixture. You then turn on the churn setting and turn the timer on for 25 minutes.  It works its magic and you have wonderful ice cream by the time dinner is consumed).
You can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the mixture in a freezer-safe container and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker, small ice crystals will form and the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but it will still be damn delicious!

To get perfectly hard boiled eggs, once the water is boiling, add your eggs and set your timer for 9 1/2 minutes.  As soon as your timer goes off, remove the eggs and put them in a bath of cold water.
Once your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.
Now you'll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.
Take the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.
Roll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.
The final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You'll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn't hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won't be as tasty.
Drop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.
Remove the fried eggs from the oil and place on a plate with paper towels to remove the excess oil.

644227,"Garlic and Herb Pork Roast With Potatoes, Wilted Spinach, and Cooling Cucumber Cream",https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/644227-556x370.jpg,45,"I pull the leaves off two sprigs of rosemary and two sprigs of oregano (about a loose 1/2 cup of herbage).  I peel and mince 4 cloves of garlic.
Along with a few glugs of EVOO, some sea salt, and some cracked black pepper, I mix all this savory yumyum into a paste in a bowl.
Then I spread it liberally along what will be the inside of my meat-wad.  See the strings laid out below?  Im going to fold this slab in half, encasing my herbaliciousness in the inside.
See?  I slide this baby into a ziplock bag and set it in the fridge to marinate for a few hours (overnight will work, too).  Its going to take at least 2 hours to roast, so I take it out around 4:00 pm
And get my roasting pan set to high heat with a few glugs of EVOO shimmering on the surface.
Im going to sear every surface of my luscious wrapped pink pig, which will help it cook through to tender later.  I leave the fat-cap for last.  Bottoms down!
Then cut side, using tongs to flip when the surface has caramelized to a lovely golden brown.
I even brown each tip, like so.
Finally, I press the sweet sweet slice of quivering pork skin onto the searing hot oiled surface of my pan. After a few moments, I flip it the final time.
The house has already started to spell amazing, and the beautiful bacony aromas released once fat hits heat is almost more than I can handle.  Almost.  The promise of porcine perfection to come keeps me in check.
Oh, Ive nestled a few thick slices of white onion under my pork roast, because I dont want the bottom to oversear before the meat can release some juices, and then I dont want the bottom to stew in those juices too much.  The onion elevates the roast while adding flavor.  I wrap this in foil paper, and set into a
Oven.  It will bake for at least 2 hours; larger roasts will take longer, but for 2 people this is just the right size, and just the right amount of time to inhale the noxious tantalizing aromas before some sort of crazy sets in.
I make my cucumber yoghurt right away, because I want the flavors to blend.  I start my peeling, then slicing
Then chopping my cucumber.
I throw it into a bowl, along with my yoghurt, 2 cloves of minced garlic, some lemon zest, the juice of 1/2 that lemon, some sea salt, cracked black pepper
And I mix it all well.  I set this in the fridge, so all the flavors can come together.  Which they do oh, baby they do.
When my roast is almost done (pretty much right at the 1:45 mark), I prep my spuds by splitting them into quarters, and tossing them with lots of EVOO, sea salt, cracked black pepper, and another 1/2 cup of chopped fresh rosemary and oregano.  Were bringing the scent and savory of the pork and potatoes together by lacing them both with the same herb blend.
I spread these out on a sheet pan, and give them another healthy dose of EVOO, just to be sure theyre very heartily coated.  I set this into the bottom shelf of my oven, right above the heating element, so that my edges will crust up nicely. Youll see.
We purchased this lovely bottle of oregano scented white balsamic vinegar at O&Co. on Newbury Street.  Tonight was the perfect time to break it out.  Have you ever had french fries with vinegar?  If not, I highly recommend it.  This is the same concept.
I had set aside the large bowl in which Id tossed my spuds; it was still coated with residual herbed EVOO, salt, and pepper.  Ive sliced my white onions into strips, and I toss them into this reservoir with another few healthy glugs of oil, and another handful of oregano leaves.  Heres where my vinegar comes in; I douse a healthy serving over this beautiful blend, stirring it all up very very well, soaking each each crisp slice of white root with dressing.  Every few minutes or so, I toss it afresh; this reactive base quick-pickles my onion slices transforming the flavor from pungent to perky sweet.
For the last 10 minutes of cooking my roast, I remove the foil from the top to expose the skin to the heat.  I can easily twist a wee bit of meat off with my fork, letting me know it is tender and perfectly ready to serve. I set the heat to 425, then stick my roast back in the oven so the skin can crisp.
Meanwhile, my onions have pickled
And Ive layered my baby spinach over them
Before I pour my spuds, sizzling oil and seared spices and all, over the whole pan.
I toss this very well, letting the hot potatoes and oil wilt my spinach, and blending the pickled onions over the whole batch.
My pork is ready to go: the fat cap is crisped and blistered, and the meat is fork-tender.
This hunk of lovemeat almost slices itself, and the herbage cleavage is like a vein of precious green flavor gold.
Topped with a cool cucumber cream, my thick, tender  slabs of herbed rolled pork roast with crispy, savory skin are perfectly partnered with my snappy spuds and buttery greens.  This is an elegant, delicious dinner that welcomes the first breezes of early spring  through freshly re-opened windows.

636393,Buckwheat Galette With An Egg,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/636393-556x370.jpg,45,"Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.
In the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.
Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).
Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.
Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.
I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.
To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.
So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.
When you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.","1 cup of milk (I used 2%%); 1/2 tablespoon a of sugar; a pinch of sea salt; 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, melted; 1/4 cup of buckwheat flour; 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour; 2 smalls eggs; 2 Eggs (for the topping)"

Start by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.
While the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.
Clean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.
As the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.
While the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.
When the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.
Drizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.
Slice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.
Serve by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.
I like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.
Garnish with the orange zest.

Allow mixture to cool about 10 minutes before pouring mixture in a large container; refrigerate a few hours until cold.
If using an ice cream maker, follow the instructions on your ice cream maker accordingly.
You can also try this without an ice cream maker by putting the ice cream mixture in a freezer-safe container, placing it in the freezer and stirring with a spoon every hour for roughly 8  10 hours.  If you try this without an ice cream maker the consistency will not be as creamy as youd get when using an ice cream maker, but the ice cream will still be great!
If you have leftovers in the freezer, thaw the ice cream at least 10 minutes before attempting to dig in because it will be much stiffer than store-bought ice cream.","2 cans full-fat coconut milk (13.6 ounces each); 1 cup half & half; ½ cup cane sugar; 6 large ripe peaches, pitted and quartered (peel on)"

In a small bowl combine the graham crumbs, sugar and melted butter.
Press into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)
To prepare the cheesecake
In a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.
Cream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.
Finally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.
Pour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.
Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)
Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven).
To finish the cheesecake
When completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired.

Over medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.
Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.
Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.
Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.
Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.
After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.

It is important to get the oil nice and hot (not smoking, just before that point) your shrimp should sizzle when added to the pan. Check the back of the shrimp and when you see the colour change about half way up, turn them over. Do the same on the other side. This should only take a minute to two minutes maximum on both sides  otherwise you will get a rubbery result if you leave it too long. Squeeze over the lime juice  this too should bubble and reduce. Add a little salt and pepper, stir through, remove from the heat and set aside.
2.Mix the dressing ingredients together, check for flavour, adjust if need be and set aside.
3.Place all the salad ingredients in a bowl except the avocado and the salt and pepper. Prepare the avocado as you are about to serve otherwise it will turn brown. Once it is covered in the lime dressing, this will slow down the oxidization process and it wont go brown so easily.

Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.
To make the sauce:
Cut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.
Using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.
To prepare the corn dogs:
In a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.
When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.
Roll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between.

Place a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.
Place a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.
Dip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.
Stand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)

In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Remove any string-like particles from the chili pods. Add them to the boiling water along with half of a packet of Goya seasoning. Cover and let boil for about 20 minutes.
Afterwards, place chili pods with 2 cups of the stock in a blender to coalesce. Drain the saucepan of the remaining stock and place back on the stove top. Return the heat to medium, and add olive oil once the remaining stock evaporates.
Add onion and beef, and immediately begin to break apart the beef. Add 1 packet of Goya seasoning and chili powder, and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Add the chili sauce and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add garlic and 2 teaspoon salt. I added the poblano pepper at this point, but I should have added it with the beef and onion.
Reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for one hour. For the last twenty minutes, partially cover the pan in order to slightly reduce. Most of the liquid should be reduced and thickened.
In a large bowl, add instant corn masa mix, water, baking powder, salt, and olive oil to create corn masa mix. The mixture should be spongy.
Whats surprisingly tricky is assembling the tamales. The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese.
O cook, you should have a double boiler. If you dont, like me, then use a metal colander and place it in a large pot. Place the tamales in the colander (or double boiler) where they are not squished, nor are they loose enough to unravel themselves. While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water.
Once water comes to a boil, reduce heat and add the tamales. Place a towel between the colander and lid, and cook for 30 minutes.","20 dried corn husks; 6 dried California chili pods, seeded with the ends cut off; 1 1/2 cups ground beef; 1 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded; 1/2 1 poblano pepper, diced; 4 cloves garlic, minced; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 1 1/2 packets Goya seasoning with onion and garlic; 2 teaspoons salt; 1 teaspoon chili powder"
640843,Crispy Southern Fried Chicken,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/640843-556x370.jpg,45,"1.Pour the buttermilk into a tray or bowl add one teaspoon of salt, mix through and place the chicken pieces into the buttermilk. Depending on the size and shape of your bowl you may need a little bit more buttermilk in order that the chicken is covered. Cover with some cling film and place in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Remove before frying to give enough time to bring the meat up to room temperature.
2.In a dish or bowl combine the flour, half teaspoon of salt, smoked paprika, thyme and pepper. Combine with your fingers or a fork.
3.Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and dispose of the marinade. Shake off most of the drips and then dredge the chicken in your flour mix making sure each piece is covered completely.
4.Heat about 1.5cm / 0.5 in. of oil in a heavy bottomed wide pan. While this is heating up you can get a wire rack ready to drain the chicken. I do this by placing kitchen paper over the rack.
5.The oil temperature should be about 170C / 340F for frying. I dont check with a thermometer but by putting a piece of bread in the oil and it is ready when it fizzes and turns brown quickly. The time the oil takes to heat up will depend on the thickness of the metal of your pan, your stove top and the quantity of oil you have used.
6.You will probably have to cook in batches so as not to over load the pan. I start with the thighs which need a little bit more time than the legs. Place each one carefully in the pan and fry, covered, on a good strong simmer for anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes on each side. The heat needs to be high enough to give you a nice brown colour and a crisp finish. Remove and set on the rack to drain. Then do the same with the legs, giving them a couple of minutes less than the thighs.","1.2kg / 2.6 lb. chicken legs and thighs.

639769,Coconut Flour Pancakes with Blueberry Honey Compote,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/639769-556x370.jpg,30,"<ol><li>Start by preparing your blueberry topping, as it can simmer while making the pancake batter. In a small saucepan over low heat, add the frozen blueberries and agave nectar and cover with a lid. If you are using fresh blueberries, add about a tablespoon of water.  After about 3 minutes, checks on the blueberries  once juices begin to seep out, add the cinnamon and stir well.  Cover again and continue to heat blueberries for about 10 to 15 minutes, checking occasionally.  The topping is ready when the juices formed are syrupy and the blueberries are plump and hot.  If youre looking for thick syrup, simply mash the blueberries with a fork while they are cooking in the saucepan.  This time, I kept the blueberries whole. Once ready, remove from heat and leave the cover on to keep warm.</li><li>While blueberries are on the stove, prepare pancake batter.  In a mixing bowl, combine all wet ingredients and beat together.  Add the coconut flour, baking powder and salt and continue to mix until all clumps are smoothed out and youre left with a very thick batter.  If you are using a mixer, you might need to scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to get the coconut flour fully integrated. Allow batter to sit for about 5 minutes.</li><li>Heat a large skillet on medium-low. Once warm, spread a dollop of butter evenly over the skillet.  Using a spoon or rubber spatula, portion out about a third of the batter and shape it into a pancake on the skillet.  Coconut flour pancakes need to be manipulated more than the standard all-purpose flour pancakes, as coconut flour tends to hold its shape.  (Note: If your pancakes begin to melt around the edges, it is because there is not enough coconut flour in your batch. Add more coconut flour a teaspoon at a time until the batter stays together on the skillet.)</li><li>Repeat this step for the remaining 2/3 of the batter (this recipe makes 3 medium-sized pancakes), giving each pancake plenty of space for flipping. Allow pancakes to sit on the skillet for about 7 to 10 minutes. Carefully work a large spatula under each pancake and gently flip (it is easy to break coconut pancakes, so the flipping process is the most difficult part about this recipe).  Allow the pancakes to cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes then remove from heat.</li><li>Top pancakes with the blueberry topping and confectioners sugar. If you are looking for more sweetness: drizzle agave nectar, honey or pure maple syrup over the tops of the cakes.</li></ol>",2 tablespoons honey or agave nectar; 1/2 teaspoon baking powder; 1/2 cup frozen blueberries; ½ teaspoon cinnamon; 3 tablespoons coconut flour; ¼ cup coconut milk; 2 eggs; 2 tablespoons honey; 1 tablespoon olive oil (or 2 tablespoons melted butter); 1 pinch Salt

636360,Brussels Sprout Carbonara with Fettuccini,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/636360-556x370.jpg,45,"Heat the oil in a non-stick pan.  When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.
Add the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.
When the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.
When the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.
When the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.
Turn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.  Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.
Check for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.
This works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.

To get started with this dish you will want to get two post of water boiling and cook your chicken breasts in one and your sausage in the other. I usually boil my chicken breasts for 15-20 minutes until the juices run clear when cut into, then cube them. For the sausage, slice it into bite sized pieces and boil for 10 minutes. Set aside after cooking to use later with the gumbo.


The roux is the most important part of a gumbo. If you don't get the roux right, you are probably not going to like your gumbo.

Over medium heat in a large pot, add your olive oil. Allow to warm for a minute, and then add in the flour. Stir constantly until all of the flour has disolved and the mixture has a lot of tiny bubbles. Once you have reached that consistency it's time to add in your garlic powder. Allow to bubble, constantly stirring for one minute.


Gradually stir in the chicken broth and the beer, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a slow simmer. Add the celery, all tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, parsley, and cajun seasoning. Reduce heat to a slow simmer, cover, and continue to simmer for 40 minutes, stirring often.

634660,Beef Pot Pies with Irish Cheddar Crust,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/634660-556x370.,45,"Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.
Begin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.
Rolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.","8 T. unsalted butter, cut into 1/4 inch pieces; 8 oz.

636787,Caldo Verde - Portuguese Kale Soup,https://img.spoonacular.com/recipes/636787-556x370.jpg,45,"Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.
Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.
Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.
Now it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.
Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.
Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.
Don't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.
In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.
Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.
Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.
With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.
Now it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.
Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!","1/2 large onion chopped; 3 carrots peeled and sliced; 3 garlic cloves smashed; 4 large yellow potatoes chopped; 2 chorizo links with casings removed, halved and chopped; 4 cups of chicken stock and 2 cups of water; 1 bunch of kale julienned; cup or 6 of water and 2 packets of Chicken Boullion; crushed red pepper flakes; salt and pepper to taste"

Place in fridge for at least an hour.</li><li>Toss lamb with salt, pepper, caraway seeds, garlic and flour.  Set aside.</li><li>As dough chills, swirl a bit of olive oil in the bottom of a very wide and deep pan. When sizzling, add lamb pieces and cook on medium heat until just browned.  Scoop onto a separate plate.</li><li>If necessary, swirl a bit more olive oil in the same pan.  Scrape up all the drippings on the pan, then slide onion and celery, cooking down until they soften and go translucent.</li><li>Pour in wine and demi glace.  Stir well.  Add lamb back to the vegetables, followed by peas and bay leaf.   Cover, turn down to a simmer and cook about 15 minutes.</li><li>Stir together water and cornstarch and pour into lamb and veggies.  Mix well.  Add sweet potatoes and cook another 5-7 minutes.  Remove from heat and cool completely.  Remove bay leaf.</li><li>Once filling has cooled, take chilled dough and, on a floured surface, roll one ball for bottom crust layer.  Drop in 9-inch pie dish and trim edges.  Place in the fridge and roll second piece of dough for top.</li><li>Remove bottom crust layer from fridge and pour in filling.  Top with second layer and trim edges if necessary.  Roll top crust edge over bottom crust.  Put back in the fridge or pop in freezer 2-4 minutes for a quick chill if dough feels at all soft.*</li><li>Just before baking, brush milk over top crust. Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for 45-50 minutes or until golden brown.</li><li>Heres where you can make this dish early. Let the filling cool completely in the fridge.  When cool, assemble pie with both layers and filling and chill until ready to bake.  As for the continuous chilling methods, this is the best way to keep a flakey crust.  Never, never, never bake soft, soggy dough.  Avoid a disaster and overchill if necessary!</li></ol>","1 bay leaf; 1/2 tablespoon black pepper; 3/4 cup butter, chilled and cubed; 1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds; 2 celery stalks, sliced; 1 tablespoon cornstarch; 3 ounces demi glace; 2 1/2 cups flour; 3 tablespoons flour; 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, chopped; 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped; 4 cloves garlic, minced; 8 tablespoons ice water; 1 tablespoon kosher salt; 1 pound lamb, cubed; Zest of 1 lemon, minced; 1 1/2 tablespoons milk; Olive oil; Zest of 1 orange, minced; 1 cup frozen peas; Crust (adapted from Simply Recipes); 1/2 large red onion, chopped; 1 cup red wine; 1 teaspoon salt; 1/2 cup shortening; 1 tablespoon sugar; 2 large sweet potatoes, parboiled, peeled and cubed; 1/2 cup water"
